# Final Project 

For this project I built a forum that could be applicable to any kind of interest. A forum for people who like to go fishing or biking, cook baby food from scratch or any other kind of acitivity. The user flow includes signing up for an account, posting questions, answering other questions, liking both questions and answers and also being able to see a change in user profile due to the user's activity. 

## The problem

Since the project includes both pages and many different components it seemed essential to use React Redux to keep track of all changes and input made by the user. In order to keept the code clear and structured I have also chosen to work with thunks to keep as much of the logic out of the components as possible.
